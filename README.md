# Cyclistic bike-share business case study
This is a case study on Cyclistic's bike-share business. This is part of the Google Data Analytics capstone project.

## The business task
The analysis is focused on finding out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Key Findings
We have some interesting findings and I categorize them into trip duration and number of rides.

Trip Duration
- Casual riders rode longer than members in general.
- Members' trip duration was consistent throughout the week, while casual riders rode longer on weekends.

Number of Rides
- Members constituted majority of the ridership. 
- Members rode more on weekdays, while casual riders rode more on weekends.
- Members' favorite routes are in the loop, while casual riders' favorite routes are in scenic areas by the lake.

## Recommendations
Based on the above findings, my recommendations are the following:
- Offer some non-monetary incentives (such as badges and ranking) to encourage casual riders to ride more.
- Offer time-limited discounted rates to convert casual riders to join membership.
- Advertise on billboards, bus stops, etc. in the scenic areas by the lake to attract people who may enjoy leisure rides.
